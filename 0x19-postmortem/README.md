Issue Summary:

Duration: The potential issue arose during the deployment of a website on March 5th, 2024, at 10:00 AM UTC and persisted until March 6th, 2024, at 4:00 PM UTC.

Impact: The deployment process was hindered, and the website was inaccessible to users during this time, potentially affecting the user experience and causing frustration among users.

Root Cause: The deployment issue stemmed from a misconfiguration in the web server setup, leading to improper serving of website files and resulting in downtime.

Timeline:

10:00 AM (UTC) - Anomalies in the deployment process were detected, leading to errors in serving website content.

10:10 AM (UTC) - Engineers initiated an investigation, initially attributing the issue to potential errors in the website files or upload process.

11:00 AM (UTC) - The investigation shifted focus towards network configurations as a potential cause for the deployment failure.

12:30 PM (UTC) - With no immediate resolution, the situation was escalated to involve senior engineers for further analysis.

2:00 PM (UTC) - Through meticulous examination, the root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the web server setup, specifically in the virtual host configuration or server block.

4:00 PM (UTC) - The issue was resolved by rectifying the misconfiguration in the web server setup, ensuring proper serving of website files.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the deployment issue was traced back to a misconfiguration in the web server setup, such as errors in the virtual host configuration or server block. This led to the improper serving of website files and subsequent downtime.

To resolve the issue, engineers rectified the misconfiguration in the web server setup, ensuring the proper serving of website files and restoring website accessibility.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect deployment anomalies promptly. Implement thorough testing procedures for website deployments to identify and address misconfigurations early in the process. Review and update documentation regarding web server configuration best practices.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch web server configuration to prevent future misconfigurations during deployments. Conduct a thorough review of recent changes to identify any other potential misconfigurations or discrepancies. Schedule regular training sessions for engineers on web server administration best practices.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar deployment issues in the future and ensure the smooth deployment and accessibility of our website.
